President Joe Biden (D) defeated Trump in the 2020 presidential election on November 3, 2020. Biden received 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232. Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Hillary Clinton (D), receiving 304 electoral votes. Key policy initiatives during Trump\\'s first term included the United States withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and First Step Act in 2018, reducing the size of the ISIS caliphate, and establishing the Space Force as an independent military branch.[1][2] Trump made more than 200 federal judicial appointments, including three U.S. Supreme Court justices. During his presidency, Trump issued nine vetoes. To read more about these vetoes, click here. On December 18, 2019, Trump became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached by the U.S. House.[3] The U.S. Senate acquitted Trump on both charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on February 5, 2020.[4] Trump was impeached a second time on January 13, 2021, for incitement of insurrection.
